  <div id="img-caption"> Hedy Lamarr often cast as a beauty but more interested in being a brain </div>
   <center> <p id="tribute-info"> 
    Hedy had a life that is worth making a movie of. <br>From growing up in a Jewish environment at a time when Europe was in turmoil, meeting some of the main protagonists who will be some of the most terrible perpetrators of the atrocities, running away and becoming a movie star in Hollywood and playing alongside grandees such as Clark Gable and Spencer Tracy, to being involved in the war effort and being an accomplished visionary and inventor.<br> An extraordinary life which saw her marry 6 times and divorce almost as many times with the final wedding with her divorce lawyer also ending in divorce ironically...<br>
      She has been the inspiration for Catwoman and Snow White's looks but she was often frustrated by the beauty box she was put it and in her own words:
      <blockquote> “Any girl can be glamorous. All you have to do is stand still and look stupid.”</blockquote>
     <p id="tribute-info"> She applied to join the inventor's council but was pushed back a few times either because she was a woman or more useful by using her beauty to raise funds for the war effort.<br></p
  <p>
    A beauty and a geek.</p></center>
